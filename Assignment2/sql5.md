## 5. Lost and Damaged Inventory
Business Problem:
Warehouse managers need to track “shrinkage” such as lost or damaged inventory to reconcile physical vs. system counts.
Fields to Retrieve:  
INVENTORY_ITEM_ID
PRODUCT_ID    
FACILITY_ID
QUANTITY_LOST_OR_DAMAGED
REASON_CODE (Lost, Damaged, Expired, etc.)  
TRANSACTION_DATE
