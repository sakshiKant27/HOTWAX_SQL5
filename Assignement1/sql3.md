# 3. Products Missing NetSuite ID  
# Business Problem:  
 A product cannot sync to NetSuite unless it has a valid NetSuite ID. The OMS needs a list of all products that still need to be created or updated in NetSuite.  
Fields to Retrieve:  
PRODUCT_ID  
INTERNAL_NAME  
PRODUCT_TYPE_ID  
NETSUITE_ID (or similar field indicating the NetSuite ID; may be NULL or empty if missing)
