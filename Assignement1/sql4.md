# 4 Product IDs Across Systems  
Business Problem:
 To sync an order or product across multiple systems (e.g., Shopify, HotWax, ERP/NetSuite), the OMS needs to know each systemâ€™s unique identifier for that product. This query retrieves the Shopify ID, HotWax ID, and ERP ID (NetSuite ID) for all products.
Fields to Retrieve:  
PRODUCT_ID (internal OMS ID)  
SHOPIFY_ID  
HOTWAX_ID  
ERP_ID or NETSUITE_ID (depending on naming)
